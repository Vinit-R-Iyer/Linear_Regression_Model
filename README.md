# Linear_Regression_Model

**About the Project**
<br>
    This Linear Regression Algorithm was one of the projects completed during my course with Internshala on Machine Learning using Python. This project uses actual data gathered and uses it to analyse the several factors affecting the sale price of a house in Seattle, North America.

**About the Machine Learning Model**
<br>
    Linear regression is a linear model, a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (Y) also known as the Target Variable. More specifically, that ‘Y’ can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (X). When there is a single input variable (X), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables, it is known as multiple linear regression. An example of the type of Linear Regression Model I obetained is given below:
